You must first realize that the file is not empty and actually contains loads of spaces, tabs and line endings. This is a program written in whitespace.
if you execute it with a whitespace interpreter you can see it waits for input and if you enter something it keeps saying "wrong".
To find the password you must dissassemble the program with a tool such as esotope-ws, then you will get asm-like code with ascii values
you can jsut decode the flag right away or you can find the password which is whitelang
flag: `flag_whitespace_is_a_beautiful_language`
