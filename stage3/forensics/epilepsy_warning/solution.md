This is a 2 part problem

if we take a look at the gif frame by frame we can see that there are 2 black frames, but if you take a closer look they aren't actually black
if you take your fill tool in your favorite image editor and fill it with white a barcode appears on the first one and some text reading "A-law" on the second

after extracting the barcode you can take it online to a barcode scanner and find the first part of the flag "flag_some_barcode_and" it just cuts of there which implies a continuation

If we look up "A-law" we can see it's an algorithm used to compress digital signals, which include audio
so if we take the tv-static frame to our image editor and save it as raw data we can import it into an audio processing program like audacity
if you import it as raw data you will get some sound waves, if you're lucky, some glitchy audio will play and then a robot will tell you the second part of the flag

if you can't hear it, you might need to adjust the speed until you hear audible sounds in the middle of the clip

flag: `flag_some_barcode_and_hidden_audio`
