You get an audio file which sounds very strange. It's a Slow-scan TV broadcast with an image encoded on it.

Firstly you need to get some SSTV software and put on martin1 mode and play the given audo file.
You should see an image of one of the competition creators behind a billboard and some coordinates.

These coordinates lead to the front of Reykjavik University in Iceland (Which sponsored the competition).

When you go there and find that billboard there will be an image of the competitions logo and a QR code, when you scan the QR code you will get the 
flag: `flag_hello_people_who_look_at_the_back_of_the_sign`
